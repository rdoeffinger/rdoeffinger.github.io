  <h1>QtPass App Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    QtPass does not share any data. It will only transmit data if you explicitly set it up to synchronise to an external git repository or put your password store on a WebDAV share. It only stores your passwords and application settings (including any keys you configure with GnuPG).
  </p>
  <p>
    Should the app start to use data beyond what is described here, it will at least be mentioned in the update notes ("What's new in this version" in the Store).
